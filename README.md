The quiz uses a flashcard-style format to reinforce active recall, improve retention, and make learning fun and interactive.

# OBJECTIVE:
To develop a functional, user-friendly flashcard system in Python that facilitates effective learning and memorization through interactive quizzes and progress tracking.

# CORE FEATURES:
1) Flashcard Management:
     Functionality for users to add,edit and delete flashcard collections(decks) and individual question/answer pairs.Presents questions one at a time.
2) Quiz Logic:
       A mechanism to present questions randomly from a selected deck and evaluate user answers.Correct/Incorrect messages with correct answers shown.Shuffles each session for variety.
3)Scoring And Feedback:
       Immediate feedback on whether an answer is correct or wrong, along with a running score or progress indicator.Encourages students based on performances.
# TECHNOLOGIES USED:
    1)Python 3.x
    2)Libraries:
           random: Generates random questions.
           time: Adds small delays for readability.
